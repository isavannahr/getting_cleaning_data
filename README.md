# getting_cleaning_data

##Description

run_analysis.R downloads a zip file and manipulates the data. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Reads in the following files:

x_test.txt

y_test.txt

x_train.txt

y_train.txt

subject_test.txt

subject_train.txt


##Steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
